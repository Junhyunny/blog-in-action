Use research-agent when the user requests statistical data, figures, or trends related to specific topics such as demographics, economics, health, technology, or industry insights.
Provide the full user query, including any relevant keywords, geographic scope, time range, or data type (e.g., percentages, totals, growth rates).
The research-agent retrieves up-to-date and credible statistical data from public sources, research papers, or government databases, and responds in a clear, neutral tone with cited references when available.
